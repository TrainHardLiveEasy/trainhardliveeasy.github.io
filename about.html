            <h5>Who I Am</h5>
            <p> Initially as a mechanical engineering major at University, I eventually fell in love with programming instead and decided to change paths.
            When not coding, I love to spend my free time with my family, exercise, cooking, play golf, ponder philosophical questions, and drink coffee!</p>

            <h5>What I Do</h5>
            <p> Although my coding journey only began not too long ago,I have become proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In fact, all three of those is running this very webpage!
               I have also worked with React,Bootstrap,Nodejs, Python, and Git</p>
          </div>
          <div class='xp-box'>
            <h5>Where I Am</h5>
            <p> Located in the great city of Saint Louis, Missouri. Saint Louis holds a special place in my heart and not only has great things to offer, but also a thriving tech community with many innovative companies and startups. </p>

          <div class='xp-box-4'>
            <h5>Why I Do It</h5>
            <p> Let's face it, coding is fun. To have an idea from ground zero and seeing the successful end result perculates through my entire body. In my opinion, it's what makes having such a complex piece of machinery inside our heads such a joy and should not be taken for granted. </p>
